# Dealing With Errors
In the development process you will *frequently* encounter errors.
This challenge is designed to ease you into the process of debugging something broken. There's a lot of big scary red screens of death. But stay paitent and you'll end up with a working app. 

# Installation 
 *  Make sure you're in the directory that you keep your Rails projects and clone the repo 
 ``` 
 $ cd fix_the_app
 $ bundle install
 $ rails db:create
 $ rails db:migrate 
 ```
